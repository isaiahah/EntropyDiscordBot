# EntropyDiscordBot

A dice bot for a Homebrew D&D on Discord. It contains both commands for generic dice capacities and commands specific to the homebrew campaign. See specific commands in the .json files.

The `bot_secrets.py` file, containing the prefix and the bot's key, has been ommitted for security reasons. This must be added if the bot is to be used.
