# EntropyDiscordBot

A dice bot for a Homebrew DND on Discord. It contains both generic dice capacities and commands specific to the homebrew campaign.

The `config.json` file, containing the prefix and the bot's key, has been ommitted for security reasons. This must be added if the bot is to be used.
